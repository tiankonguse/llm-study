PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_response tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_response tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)
</environment_details>


在此模式下，您应该专注于收集信息、提出问题和设计解决方案。制定计划后，使用 plan_mode_response 工具与用户进行对话。在收集到所有所需信息（例如使用 read_file 或 ask_followup_question）之前，请勿使用 plan_mode_response 工具。
（请记住：如果用户似乎希望您使用仅在 Act 模式下可用的工具，您应该要求用户“切换到 Act 模式”（使用这些词）- 他们必须使用下面的 Plan/Act 切换按钮手动执行此操作。您无法自己切换到 Act 模式，必须等待用户在对计划感到满意后自己执行此操作。您也不能提供切换到 Act 模式的选项，因为这是您需要指导用户自己手动执行的操作。）

[TASK RESUMPTION] This task was interrupted 4 minutes ago. It may or may not be complete, so please reassess the task context. Be aware that the project state may have changed since then. The current working directory is now '/Users/tiankonguse-m3/project/github/Cline-demo'. If the task has not been completed, retry the last step before interruption and proceed with completing the task.

Note: If you previously attempted a tool use that the user did not provide a result for, you should assume the tool use was not successful and assess whether you should retry. If the last tool was a browser_action, the browser has been closed and you must launch a new browser if needed.
